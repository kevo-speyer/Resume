    \section{PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE} 
    {\sl Sr. Machine Learning Engineer} at {\bf D24} \hfill 2022 - Present
    \begin{itemize}  \itemsep -2pt %reduce space between items
        \item Deployed a webapp to redirect deposits using predictive timeseries ML models, decreasing
            manual intervension 80\%.
        \item Developed a credit card fraud detection API using LightGBM, Flask, Docker and AWS, 
            reducing chargebacks by 60\%.
%        \item Using 3rd party sport-events APIs and performing feature engineering, managed to 
%            reduce 10\% the mean error in our predictive cash-in models.
        \item Built a Life-Time Value model to help our partners drive retargeting campaigns and maximize their ROI,
            using DynamoDB and FasAPI.
        \item Designed an API to perform real-time aggregations of user's historical data on multiple dimensions,
            allowing to create various hard rules to prevent fraud.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}  \itemsep -2pt %reduce space between items
        \item In charge of the module that controls the offering price of the
            real-time bidder, increasing the spend from 92\% to 98\%
            of the budget using control theory.
%        \item Implemented an online mechanism to enhance the spend distribution 
%            during a day.
%        \item Implemented a second order descend mechanism to find an optimal bidding range,
%            reducing manual intervention by 40\%.
        \item Developed a nonparametric A/B testing platform that enabled the whole company to 
            correctly assess the outcome of experiments for non-gaussian data. 
%        \item Designed an online sampling algorithm to improve the uncapped
%            costs and clicks estimations.
        \item Constructed a dashboard to meassure the key spend metrics and monitor
            efficency of services with Airflow and Superset.
        \item Implemented a Machine Learning model to target devices looking at their
            historical behavior (LTV), reducing cost per action up to 30\%.

            algorithm to optimize the use of resources in the meat industry, increasing revenue 25\%.
        \item Developed a revenue management web app for the airline industry 
            using a feedback control loop algorithm and clustering which automated fare prices updates.
%        \item Researched a cost-effective way to reduce the amount of 
%		     backup disks in warehouse, implementing ML models. 
         \item Developed a theme specific text generator webapp retraing a LLM (GPT-2) fine tunned to 
             texts scrapped from the web using Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Flask and Docker.
        \item Implemented a Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning) algorithm 
            to optimize a logistics problem with OR-Tools as benchmark.
%		 \item Developed a dashboard in Redash to monitor critical performance metrics at Rappi
